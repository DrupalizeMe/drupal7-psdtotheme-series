One Hour

Title: PSD to Theme
Conference: Acquia webinar

The problem with creating a Drupal theme is—once you know how—it becomes intuitive. Themers spontaneously transform design files into complete Drupal themes without realizing all of the little steps their brain takes to achieve the final solution. It's sort of like those “learn to draw a cat” books which take you from a basic circle to a perfectly sketched cat in four "simple" steps. In this webinar we'll remove the mystery and teach you the step-by-step strategies themers use to create amazing, extensible themes.

Your instructor for the webinar, Emma Jane Westby, has been teaching people how to theme for years. Her first book, Front End Drupal, was consistently cited as the best book to learn Drupal theming. She's brought her book up-to-date in a video lesson series for Drupalize.Me, and will share the highlights with you during this one-hour webinar.

In this webinar you will learn:

The strategies themers use to quickly transform design files into Drupal themes
How to document your process so that none of your design decisions are abandoned in static design files
How to connect Drupal to your design by targeting specific elements
Which tools will save you time in building out your Drupal theme (and which ones are going to slow you down)


Title: Breaking Down Component-Based Web Design
Conference: MinneWebCon
Date: April 14, 2014

Experienced front end developers spontaneously transform static design files into complete CMS themes without realizing all of the little steps their brain takes to achieve the final solution. In this session we’ll reveal the step-by-step strategies and techniques needed to pull apart a static design file, and rebuild it as a CMS theme. You will learn the principles behind:

- style guides and interface design patterns
- libraries for rapid front end development
- object-oriented CSS with SASS and Compass
- extracting useful assets from static design files

This session gives a high-level overview of the front end development process. It is not a thorough tutorial, but rather it shows the role of each of the different technologies used by front end developers today. This session is perfect not only for those interested in learning front end development, but also for project managers who want to improve their team’s process for designer-to-coder tasks.





1/2 Day Workshop
=============================
Title: Component-Based Web Design
Conference: MinneWebCon
Date: April 15, 2014
slides: slides/workshop-halfday.html
url: http://minnewebcon.org/workshop/component-based-web-design/ 

Experienced front end developers spontaneously transform static design files into complete CMS themes without realizing all of the little steps their brain takes to achieve the final solution. In this session you’ll learn, and get to practice, the step-by-step strategies and techniques needed to pull apart a static design file, and rebuild it as a CMS theme. You will learn the principles behind:

- component-based design for responsive Web design
- creating style guides using interface design patterns
- libraries for rapid front end development
- object-oriented CSS with SASS and Compass
- organizing themes using object-oriented CSS best practices
- extracting usable assets from static design files

This session gives a high-level overview of the front end development process, and then dives into hands-on activities for the trickiest parts of the design-to-theme process. With start-to-finish examples, this workshop is perfect for designers wanting to learn front end development techniques; developers wanting to improve their design literacy skills; and project managers who want to improve their team’s communication.

This is a process-oriented workshop with hands-on activities designed for individuals working on Web production teams. e.g. designer, coder, or project manager. They should have sufficient vocabulary about web design to *either* be able to discuss design elements, and/or front end languages (HTML, CSS).

Those who have a development environment setup (e.g. coders) will be able to complete code-related activities at their own pace. Those who do not have a development environment setup (e.g. project managers) may choose to pair up with one who does; or will be given alternate activities to discuss the pros and cons for the steps outlined for their team. This team-centered approach makes the workshop valuable to the range of people we see working on modern Web development teams.

With start-to-finish examples, this workshop is perfect for designers wanting to learn front end development techniques; developers wanting to improve their design literacy skills; and project managers who want to improve their team's communication.

## Learning Objectives

- Identify components in a static design file using a list of established design patterns.
- Describe the generalized process for breaking down a static design file into assets and their related CSS style rules.
- Apply the concepts of component-based design to a Drupal theme

Digital handouts will be provided for learners wanting to build either a Drupal 7 or a Drupal 8 theme. The best practices of component-based design apply equally to both versions of Drupal.

## Syllabus

- Morning - Part 1 - component-based Web design for responsive web sites
- Morning - Part 2 - creating style guides using interface design patterns
- Afternoon - Part 1 - object-oriented CSS with Sass and Compass
- Afternoon - Part 2 - applying your styles to Drupal

## Who will gain the most from this course?

Designers, novice themers/front-end developers, and project managers.
