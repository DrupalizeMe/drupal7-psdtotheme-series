# Working with Designs

Your theme is a collection of rendered patterns.

# Design Analysis
A single design can have many interpretations

Activity: write down everything that you see. Create a "style"
guide for this design. Some things might be a single field, but
other times it might be a cluster of elements. For example:
identify the content and lists of content. Sometimes what you
are observing is a container that things fit into (e.g. how
many columns?). There are several right answers. 

- Ideally you'd write every item on a list which can be shuffled into categories easily. 
- Ideally you'd have a list of patterns (from the previous
  section) to reference when doing your design analysis.

Activity: as a group, review what people wrote down. There
should be words like:

- images/decorations
- content/node
- menus
- regions
- navigation
- headings

There are definitely three regions on the design. It's not
clear how items #4 and #5 should be rendered. Depending on how
the banner image is added to the design, it’s possible you’d
want to make that a region too.

Discussion: what are some of the reasons to create #4 and #5 as
their own regions? What are some of the drawbacks to doing
this?

# Style Guide
- A style guide is a summary of patterns which is used to
  implement content in a consistent manner.
- It establishes the expected behaviour for future content.

Activity:
Categorize the elements you identified from the Domicile design
into the following categories:

- Base
- Layout
- Component

Activity: create TXT file stubs for base, layout, and one for
each component. These will become your Sass files. Organize your
style guide, and add text-based details for everything you've
identified which needs styling.

# Asset Library

Non-editorial / static images that are not uploaded as part of
the site’s content. Typically persistent from screen-to-screen
(e.g. logo or banner).

Your asset library extends your style guide with relevant
binary assets (images).

# Prototype

- A web page which can be viewed as flat HTML + CSS.

- Choose your grid framework and start building based on the
  style guide you established previously.

- For example:
