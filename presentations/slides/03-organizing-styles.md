## Organizing Styles

Note: We'll focus on three of these: Base, Layout, and Component

## Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS

SMACSS was created by Jonathan Snook
http://smacss.com/

----------
## All SMACSS Rules

- Base rules (HTML element overrides)
- Layout rules (wire frames)
- Component rules (anything that can be placed, or reused on your site)
- State rules (augments and overrides)
- Theme rules (variations)

----------
## Simplified SMACSS

- ``components``
  - almost everything
- ``base`` OR ``global``
  - HTML elements
  - resets and overrides
- ``layout``
  - grid framework and layout definitions
  - preserve your sanity by using a framework

----------
## Summary

- We use standard libraries and organizational framework to help make our styles predictable, and findable for our future selves.
- We know sometimes the rules in frameworks are too rigid, and we may choose to bend the rules sometimes.
- We allow ourselves to pick and choose from frameworks where it suits our needs...and simplify them when necessary.
