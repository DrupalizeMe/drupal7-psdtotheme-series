## Component / Pattern Libraries

Your web site is a collection of rendered component patterns.

## Activity: Create a Component Library

Component Libraries are a way to catalog things which will appear on a particular Web site.

Using pea.rs as a reference, let's name the components on the following two designs.


Note: You can't theme something you cannot describe with words. Being able to describe a problem with words is the gateway to coding a solution.

Note: layout and base rules. Write them down to the side for now. We need to know this information, but we're not going to use it yet.

## Summary

- Pattern, or Component, Libraries range from the very simple, to the very "enterprise".
- By recognizing components in your web site, you more quickly apply HTML+CSS patterns in your front end work.
- Using written words to describe designs is the first step in converting a design to code.
