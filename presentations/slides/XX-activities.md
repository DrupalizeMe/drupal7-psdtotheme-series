# Activities

This workshop has been built over the last several years. Below are some of the activities past instructors have found to be effective. You may wish to include some of them in your teaching of this content.

----
## Activity: Create a Pattern Vocabulary

What should/could you be looking for in your designs?

Using the following headings, write down a list of every type of component you can think of:

- Content type
- Aggregation of content
- Navigation
- Other? (create your own category!)

------
## Activity: Create a "style" guide

Write down everything that you see on a given Web site; or for a given mockup. Some things might be a single field, but other times it might be a cluster of elements. For example: identify the content and lists of content. Sometimes what you
are observing is a container that things fit into (e.g. how many columns?). There are several right answers. 

- Ideally you'd write every item on a list which can be shuffled into categories easily. 
- Ideally you'd have a list of patterns (from the previous
  section) to reference when doing your design analysis.

------
## Activity: Review style guides

As a group, review what people wrote down in the previous activity.

Your style guide may include the following types of components, or elements:

- images/decorations
- content/node
- menus
- regions
- navigation
- headings

Note: There are definitely three regions on the design. It's not clear how items #4 and #5 should be rendered. Depending on how the banner image is added to the design, it’s possible you’d want to make that a region too.

Note: Discussion: what are some of the reasons to create #4 and #5 as their own regions? What are some of the drawbacks to doing this?

---------------
## Activity: Organizing by SMACSS Rules

Categorize the elements you identified from the Domicile design
into the following categories:

- Base
- Layout
- Component

Create TXT file stubs for base, layout, and one for
each component. These will become your Sass files. Organize your
style guide, and add text-based details for everything you've
identified which needs styling.

  style guide you established previously.
